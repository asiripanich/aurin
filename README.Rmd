The goal of `aurinapi` is to provide an easy way for R users to download [AURIN](https://aurin.org.au/) datasets using their [API](https://aurin.org.au/resources/aurin-apis/aurin-open-api-and-r/).

## Installation

You can install the released version of `aurinapi` from [GitHub](https://github.com/asiripanich/aurinapi) with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("asiripanich/aurinapi")
```

This package requires the [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) package. Please see the sf package's [GitHub page](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) to install its non R dependencies.

## Example

Let's recreate this [AURIN API AND R](https://aurin.org.au/resources/aurin-apis/aurin-open-api-and-r/) example using `aurinapi`.

First, you must add your [AURIN API username and password](https://aurin.org.au/resources/aurin-apis/sign-up/) as an R environment variable to your `.Renviron` file. `aurinapi` provides `aurinapi_register()` function to help you with this step. If you choose to set `add_to_renviron = TRUE` you won't need to run this step again on current machine after you restart your R session.

``` r
library(aurinapi)

# add_to_renviron = TRUE, so you won't need to run this step again on current machine.
aurinapi_register(username = "your-username", password = "your-password", add_to_renviron = T)  
```

`aurinapi_browse()` opens [the data catalogue of AURIN](https://data.aurin.org.au/dataset) on your default browser.

``` r
aurinapi_browse()
```

Identify the '**AURIN Open API ID**' field on the 'Additional Info' table of the dataset that you want to download. For example, for this [public toilet 2017 dataset](https://data.aurin.org.au/dataset/au-govt-dss-national-public-toilets-2017-na) its '**AURIN Open API ID**' field is `"aurin:datasource-au_govt_dss-UoM_AURIN_national_public_toilets_2017"`.

> Note that, some datasets on AURIN may not have '**AURIN Open API ID**', meaning that it cannot be downloaded via their API.


Alternatively, you may use `aurinapi_meta` to search datasets without leaving  your R console.

```{r}
meta = aurinapi_meta()
# print out the first five rows
knitr::kable(head(meta))
```

Use `aurinapi_get()` to download the dataset.

```{r}
# download this public toilet dataset.
open_api_id = "aurin:datasource-au_govt_dss-UoM_AURIN_national_public_toilets_2017"
public_toilets = aurinapi_get(open_api_id = open_api_id)
```

Let's visualise the data using the `ggplot2` package.

```{r example-public-toilet-plot, dpi = 300}
# If you don't have the package you can install it with `install.packages("ggplot2")`.
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(public_toilets) +
  geom_sf() +
  labs(title = "Public toilets in Australia, 2017")
```

See [here](https://data.aurin.org.au/group/aurin-api) to find available datasets.

## Advanced example

Download multiple datasets in parallel.

Setup the workers.

``` r
library(furrr)
library(future)
future::plan(future::multiprocess, workers = 2)
```

Get AURIN Open API ids of datasets with 'toilet' in their titles.

```{r}
knitr::kable(meta[grepl("toilet", meta$title, ignore.case = T), ])
```

Get all the datasets in parallel.

```r
ids_of_household_datasets = meta$aurin_open_api_id[grepl("toilet", meta$title, ignore.case = T)]
data_lst = furrr::future_map(ids_of_household_datasets, aurinapi_get)
```
